     * the height causes the map to shrink to keep the content in view. The benefit is that,
     * regardless of any resizes, the field of view is constant, which means there is no change in
     * the distortion of buildings near the edges. However the trade off is that the zoom level
     * changes, which means that the map will pull in new tiles, hence causing some flickering.
     *
     * `dynamic` means that the focal length is calculated based on the supplied [[fov]] and
     * [[viewportHeight]], this means that the map doesn't scale (the image is essentially cropped
     * but not shrunk) when the [[viewportHeight]] or [[viewportWidth]] is changed. The benefit is
     * that the zoom level is (currently) stable during resize, because the focal length is used,
     * however the tradeoff is that changing from a small to a big height will cause the fov to
     * change a lot, and thus introduce distortion.
