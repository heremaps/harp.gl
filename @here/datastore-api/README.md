# Generated DataStore API

This API is generated directly from the official OpenAPI (formerly swagger) definition of DataStore.

**Note**: Please don't edit the generated `api.ts` file, but update the generator instead.

The `api.ts` file can be regenerated by running with the `tsgen` script of `@here/swaggergen` in the `src` subdirectory, for example:

```sh
npm install --no-save @here/swaggergen
cd src
node ../node_modules/\@here/swaggergen/src/tsgen.js <path to swagger spec>
```

Please refer to the DataStore team for the latest location of the OpenAPI/Swagger spec.
