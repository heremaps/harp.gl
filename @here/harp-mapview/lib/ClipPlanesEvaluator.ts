     * @param nearMin - minimum allowable near plane distance from camera, must be bigger than zero.
     * @param nearFarMarginRatio - minimum distance between near and far plane, as a ratio of
     * average near/far plane distance, it have to be significantly bigger than zero (especially if

     * @note Keep in mind that this evaluator does not evaluate terrain (or building) elevation
     * automatically, to keep such features rendered (between frustum planes) use [[minElevation]],
