    /**
     * Starts worker by first attempting load from `scriptUrl` using native `Worker` constructor.
     * Then waits (using [[waitWorkerInitialized]]) for its successfull initialization. In case of
     * error falls back to [[startWorkerBlob]].
     *
     * This method is needed as browsers in general forbid to load worker if it's not on 'same
     * origin' regardless of Content-Security-Policy.
     *
     * For blob-based fallback work, one need to ensure that Content Security Policy (CSP) allows
     * loading web worker code from `Blob`s. By default browsers, allow 'blob:' for workers, but
     * this may change.
     *
     * Following snippet setups CSP, so workers can be started from blob urls:
     *
     *     <head>
     *         <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="child-src blob:">
     *     </head>
     *
     * Tested on:
     *   * Chrome 67 / Linux, Window, OSX, Android
     *   * Firefox 60 / Linux, Windows, OSX
     *   * Edge 41 / Windows
     *   * Safari 11 / OSX
     *   * Samsung Internet 7.2
     *

     * Findings:
     *
     * * Chrome reports CSP by exception when constructing [[Worker]] instance.
     * * Firefox reports CSP errors when loading in first event:
     *   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1241888
     * * Firefox 62, Chrome 67 obeys `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` with
     *   `worker-src blob:` but doesn't obey `worker-src URL` when used
     * * Chrome 67 doesn't obey CSP `worker-src URL` despite it's documented as supported
     *   (https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/worker-src)
