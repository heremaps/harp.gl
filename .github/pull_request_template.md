# CI Check

Our bots will check whether your PR can be directly integrated into the mainline. We have some internal integration tests running on the background, our bots will inform you of the next steps and someone from our team will take a look and help if needed!

And please do not forget to sign-off your commit! You can read more about DCO [here](https://julien.ponge.org/blog/developer-certificate-of-origin-versus-contributor-license-agreements/). But, in short, you just need to use `git commit -s` or append `--signoff` when you are committing to the repo.

Happy contributing!
