# harp.gl

`harp.gl` is an open-source 3D map rendering engine.

You can use this engine to:

  * Develop visually appealing 3D maps
  * Create highly animated and dynamic map visualization with WebGL, using the popular [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) library.
  * Create themeable maps, with themes that can change on the fly.
  * Create a smooth map experience with highly performant map rendering and decoding. Web workers parallelize the CPU intensive tasks, for optimal responsiveness.
  * Design your maps modularly, where you can swap out modules and data providers as required.

## Installation
