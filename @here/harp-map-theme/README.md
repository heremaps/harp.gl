### Inspiration for the Style

The [style](resources/berlin_tilezen_base.json) is called `berlin`, inspired by the vibrant city of [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), where most of the development of `harp.gl` is done.

The choice of colors from the city itself, [blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oberbaumbr%C3%BCcke_mit_U-Bahn.jpg) from the river Spree,
[green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cityscape_Berlin.jpg) from the many parks and forests of the city and
yellow because of the color of the taxis and
[the public transport system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Verkehrsbetriebe).

We provide two variants based on the same `berlin` theme, a [dark](resources/berlin_tilezen_night_reduced.json) one and a [reduced](resources/berlin_tilezen_night_reduced.json) one.
