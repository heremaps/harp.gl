 * The DataSource Protocol package contains components used for the decoding and styling
 * of data that is used by the Datasources.
 * This code is shared between the ui-thread and the web-workers which are
 * used to parallelise the decoding of the data.
 * This module contains interfaces for choosing techniques form the techniques
 * catalog that are applied via the {@link Theme} files to draw geometries on the map canvas.
