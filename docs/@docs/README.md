# Additional documentation

This directory contains markdown documents that will be integrated to typedoc output.

## How to add a new document

1. Create a new subdirectory with the name that should be used to identify the document at the
   table of contents generated by typedoc.
2. Create a file named *README.md* in the subdirectory and add there the documentation.
3. Add an dummy ts file (it must have a license header) to force typedoc to process the subdirectory.
4. Optionally, add *.mmd* files containing mermaid diagrams. These will be rendered into svg files
   which can be included as images in any markdown file. E.g.:
    * A mermaid diagram is located at *@docs/dir1/diagram1.mmd*.
    * The diagram can be added to a markdown file using the reference *media://dir1/diagram1.svg*.
    * Since diagrams are large, it's better to add them as thumbnails linking to the full-sized image using HTML:
   ```html
    <a href="media://dir1/diagram1.svg">
        <img src="media://dir1/diagram1.svg" alt="drawing1" title="Diagram" width="100"/>
    </a>
    ```
