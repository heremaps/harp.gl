# Additional documentation

This directory contains markdown documents that will be integrated to typedoc output.

## How to add a new document

1. Create a new subdirectory with the name that should be used to identify the document at the
   table of contents generated by typedoc.
2. Create a file named 'README.md' in the subdirectory and add there the documentation.
3. Add an empty ts file to force typedoc to process the subdirectory.
